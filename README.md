A Rust and [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) implementation of the Kryptonite Protocol market on the [seinetwork blockchain](https://www.seinetwork.io/).

You can find information about the architecture, usage, and function of the smart contracts in the [documentation]().

### Dependencies


## Contracts

## Development

### Environment Setup

- Rust v1.44.1+
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Docker

1. Install `rustup` via https://rustup.rs/

2. Run the following:

```sh
rustup default stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

3. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed.

### Unit / Integration Tests

Each contract contains Rust unit and integration tests embedded within the contract source directories. You can run:

```sh
cargo unit-test
cargo integration-test
```

### Compiling

After making sure tests pass, you can compile each contract with the following:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
cp ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw1_subkeys.wasm .
ls -l cw1_subkeys.wasm
sha256sum cw1_subkeys.wasm
```

#### Production

For production builds, run the following:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.12.6
```

This performs several optimizations which can significantly reduce the final size of the contract binaries, which will be available inside the `artifacts/` directory.
